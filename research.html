      My research focuses on irrigation dynamics, water scarcity, and sectoral water competition under climate and socioeconomic change.
      It integrates AI-enabled remote sensing, hydrologic &amp; crop–water modeling, and geospatial analysis to support decision-relevant
      pathways for sustainable water and food systems.

      <h2>1) How do fine-scale irrigation dynamics shape water scarcity and hydrologic sustainability under climate stress?</h2>

      <p>
        Irrigated agriculture sustains nearly 40% of global food production yet remains the largest consumer of freshwater, driving depletion
        of surface and groundwater reserves in many regions. However, the hydrologic implications of irrigation are poorly quantified due to
        limited fine-scale data on where, when, and how irrigation occurs. Building on my current work developing global irrigation datasets,
        I will use AI-enabled remote sensing and multi-source satellite imagery to map irrigation intensity and timing at fine spatial and temporal
        resolutions. By integrating these data with hydrological and crop models (e.g., CWatM, WaterGAP2e), I will quantify consumptive water use,
        irrigation efficiency, and groundwater recharge deficits under varying climate and management scenarios. This approach links the spatial
        footprint of irrigation to basin-scale water balance dynamics—diagnosing when and where irrigation transitions from sustainable use to
        hydrologic stress. I will also evaluate how improved irrigation scheduling, water-saving technologies, or crop-switching strategies can mitigate
        scarcity while maintaining productivity. The ultimate goal is to provide decision-relevant tools that connect irrigation management to measurable
        outcomes in water availability and ecosystem resilience.

      <h2>2) How is global &amp; local water scarcity evolving, and what are the impacts on food production and supply?</h2>

      <p>
        Global water scarcity has become a critical challenge for billions of people, impacting numerous regions and threatening sustainable development
        and livelihoods. Because of water's immense importance in supporting food production—and dependent on local and global food demands—the implications
        of different forms of water scarcity (green, blue, economic) can be felt across scales. Past assessments of water scarcity in the context of food
        systems have been limited by outdated datasets and have failed to connect places of production with locations of final consumption. Leveraging the
        latest global monthly crop-specific data on irrigated and rainfed areas (MIRCA-OS), I perform a comprehensive two-part assessment of the evolution
        of global water scarcity. First, I quantify physical and economic limitations to crop production, assessing crop-specific exposure to blue and green
        water scarcity, the persistence of economic water scarcity, and its driving factors. Second, I evaluate the evolution of global water risk in relation
        to food supply and nutrition, leveraging bilateral food trade matrices to connect food production and supply in water-scarce regions with places of consumption.
        These findings highlight water-scarcity exposure of crop-specific production baskets, the economic and infrastructural factors limiting irrigation expansion,
        and the water risks of local and distant consumers who rely on these scarce resources.

      <h2>3) How does climate change alter water resources and river systems under growing human pressures?</h2>

      <p>
        Climate change is fundamentally altering hydrological regimes through shifts in temperature, precipitation, river discharge, and sediment dynamics, 
        intensifying pressures on water availability, flood risk, and ecosystem stability—particularly in data-scarce river basins of sub-Saharan Africa, 
        where urban growth, agriculture, and hydraulic infrastructure compound climate stress. This research integrates climate impact assessment, 
        hydrological model uncertainty, and river morphological analysis by combining statistically downscaled regional climate projections 
        with multi-model hydrological simulations and one-dimensional morphological modeling. By aggregating ensemble 
        climate scenarios and linking altered flow regimes to channel and delta responses using remote sensing and geomorphological analysis, 
        the work provides a robust, integrated framework for understanding climate–human interactions in river systems and supports adaptive, 
        evidence-based water resource management.
