        <h2 class="card-title">1) How do fine-scale irrigation dynamics shape water scarcity and hydrologic sustainability under climate stress?</h2>

        <p>
          Irrigated agriculture sustains nearly 40% of global food production yet remains the largest consumer of freshwater,
          driving depletion of surface and groundwater reserves in many regions. However, the hydrologic implications of
          irrigation are poorly quantified due to limited fine-scale data on where, when, and how irrigation occurs.
          Building on my current work developing global irrigation datasets, I will use AI-enabled remote sensing and
          multi-source satellite imagery to map irrigation intensity and timing at fine spatial and temporal resolutions.

        </figure>

        <p>
          By integrating these data with hydrological and crop models (e.g., CWatM, WaterGAP2e), I will quantify
          consumptive water use, irrigation efficiency, and groundwater recharge deficits under varying climate and
          management scenarios. This approach links the spatial footprint of irrigation to basin-scale water balance
          dynamics—diagnosing when and where irrigation transitions from sustainable use to hydrologic stress. I will also
          evaluate how improved irrigation scheduling, water-saving technologies, or crop-switching strategies can mitigate
          scarcity while maintaining productivity. The ultimate goal is to provide decision-relevant tools that connect
          irrigation management to measurable outcomes in water availability and ecosystem resilience.

        <h2 class="card-title">2) How is global &amp; local water scarcity evolving, and what are the impacts on food production and supply?</h2>

        <p>
          Global water scarcity has become a critical challenge for billions of people, impacting numerous regions and
          threatening sustainable development and livelihoods. Because of water's immense importance in supporting food
          production—and dependent on local and global food demands—the implications of different forms of water scarcity
          (green, blue, economic) can be felt across scales. Past assessments of water scarcity in the context of food
          systems have been limited by outdated datasets and have failed to connect places of production with locations of
          final consumption.

        </figure>

        <p>
          Leveraging the latest global monthly crop-specific data on irrigated and rainfed areas (MIRCA-OS), I perform a
          comprehensive two-part assessment of the evolution of global water scarcity. First, I quantify physical and
          economic limitations to crop production, assessing crop-specific exposure to blue and green water scarcity, the
          persistence of economic water scarcity, and its driving factors. Second, I evaluate the evolution of global water
          risk in relation to food supply and nutrition, leveraging bilateral food trade matrices to connect food
          production and supply in water-scarce regions with places of consumption. These findings highlight the water
          scarcity exposure of crop-specific production baskets, the economic and infrastructural factors limiting irrigation
          expansion, and the water risks of local and distant consumers who rely on these scarce resources.

        <h2 class="card-title">3) How do climate change and urban growth drive water competition between cities and agriculture?</h2>

        <p>
          Agriculture, which consumes the majority of global freshwater, is therefore caught in a critical dilemma: how to
          maintain essential food production while competing with burgeoning cities for shrinking water resources. Studying
          this issue is paramount, as conflicts over water allocation are already rising in many regions. My research will
          examine how these converging pressures manifest by integrating datasets on climate trends, urban expansion, water
          policies, and agricultural irrigation demand. Through advanced geospatial analysis and modeling, this work will
          help inform evidence-based policy for balancing food production with urban water security, offering crucial
          insights for adaptive water governance strategies.
